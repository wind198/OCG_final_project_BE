We do not recommend placing natural timber items directly onto carpets or rugs - using a protective liner will assist.||The character and appearance of knots, variety of colours and grains and cracks are inherently characteristic to the wood and not considered defects.||No refund, replacement or exchange will be offered due to the look of the timber as described here.
